1.1-1
Sorting: The professor could sort all scores of final exam to find the student who get highest score.

1.1-2
Memory allocation: The memory of computer is limited, so the program should spend acceptable memory on the algorithm.

1.1-3
Linked list: strengths: could do add or remove operation easily.
             limitations: would spend more time to do searching operation than binary search tree does.

1.1-4
Similar: They are both find a shortest path on the graph.
Different: The shortest path produce a path, which do not need travel to start vertex.
           The traveling-salesman produce a circle, which the end vertex should be same to the start vertex.

1.1-5
Sorting: The algorithm of sorting must produce correct sorting to make it meaningful.
Shortest-path: The algorithm could still work even though there are some probability to make the path not shortest.
